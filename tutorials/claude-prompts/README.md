| Platform scrapers | 4 (X, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads) | 04, 17 | [docs/api-reference.md](../../docs/api-reference.md) |

Feature areas with a prompt of their own: autonomous Space agent (23), workflow
engine (21), real-time streaming (14, 21), sentiment analysis (18), account
portability (21), customer service (19), session logging and rate-limit safety

<command>`, and the docs linked above do.
